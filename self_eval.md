# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
- It's useful to use conditionals when writing if else statements - When you need to determine what course of action to take and what feedback to give based on user input.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
- I would not have spent so much time on the spicy code challenge. It was good for me to do some research but I ultimately didn't learn anything and sort of wasted my time.
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
- I find if else statements to be really fun to write (at least at this point in my education!) And I'm happy with the research I did and the progress I've made and how I am mostly grasping things to do with conditionals.
